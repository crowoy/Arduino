Basic Arduino Uno Projects

After getting an Arduino Uno 2 years ago, I decided to embark on some small projects to get my started.

These are a few of them:

### Auto Traffic Lights
This is a traffic light simulation where the Arduino will automatically switch between the different LEDs based on time.

### LED Dimmer
It is possible to dim an LED from the Arduino by passing the board different voltages to the LEDs.

### Night Lights
Switch between day and night mode (dim and bright).

### Traffic Lights
Again, this is a traffic lights simulation. However, this time it works like an actual traffic light (i.e. push a physical button and it queues a change in the traffic light).
